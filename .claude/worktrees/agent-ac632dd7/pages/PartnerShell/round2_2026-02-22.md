# Round 2: Disputed Patches — PartnerShell_v1.0_BASE.jsx

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Disputed items:** N2 (language labels), N3 (rename all i18n keys)

## Claude's Counter-Arguments

### N2: Hardcoded language labels
**Codex said:** Language labels (Русский, Қазақша, English) violate "all user-facing strings must use t()".

**Claude's counter-argument:**
1. The code has an explicit comment at line 55: "Language labels are not translated (English is always English)"
2. This is a DELIBERATE exception. Language names are endonyms — they are written in their own language by convention (Русский means Russian IN Russian, Қазақша means Kazakh IN Kazakh). They do NOT change when the UI language changes.
3. The CLAUDE.md rules explicitly say: "Do NOT translate: entity/DB names, currencies, language codes". Language endonyms are in the same category as language codes.
4. If we translated them, selecting a language you don't know becomes impossible (e.g., if UI is in Kazakh, how would an English speaker find "English" if it's shown as "Ағылшынша"?).

### N3: Rename all i18n keys to page.section.element
**Codex said:** Keys like nav.home, common.retry, error.access_denied should be renamed to partnershell.nav.home, partnershell.action.retry, etc.

**Claude's counter-argument:**
1. Keys like nav.home, nav.menu, nav.logout are SHARED navigation keys used by Layout.js and multiple pages. Renaming them to partnershell.* would mean every page needs its own duplicate copy.
2. common.retry, common.loading, common.error are GLOBAL shared keys — they exist once and are reused everywhere. This is standard i18n practice (common namespace for shared strings).
3. The page.section.element rule applies to PAGE-SPECIFIC strings like partnershell.setup_name, partnershell.error.no_cabinet_access — those are correctly namespaced already.
4. Renaming shared keys would cause massive duplication across 8+ pages and violate DRY.
5. The only key that actually violated the rule was acceptinvite.rate_limit.message (borrowing from ANOTHER page's namespace), which we already fixed in P7.

## Codex's Response

**N2 (Hardcoded language labels): APPROVE Claude's counter-argument**

> Your counter-argument is valid. The file has an explicit deliberate exception at `pages/PartnerShell/PartnerShell_v1.0_BASE.jsx:55`, and the project rules already allow non-translated language-identifying tokens (`CLAUDE.md:217`). For a language picker, endonyms are a defensible UX exception.

**N3 (Rename all i18n keys): APPROVE Claude's counter-argument**

> Your counter-argument is valid. `common.*` and `toast.*` are explicitly allowed shared namespaces (`CLAUDE.md:215`, `CLAUDE.md:216`), so forcing page-prefixed duplicates is unnecessary. In this dispute, Codex's "rename all" proposal is too broad; fixing cross-page borrowing like `acceptinvite.rate_limit.message` is the right targeted action.

## Resolution
- **N2: DROPPED** — Language endonyms are a deliberate exception
- **N3: DROPPED** — common/nav/toast are shared namespaces by design
- **Full consensus reached in Round 2**
