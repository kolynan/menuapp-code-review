We are continuing the discussion about MenuApp Client Home Screen UX. Here was your previous analysis (summarized key points):

YOUR PREVIOUS POSITION (Codex Round 1):
- Hierarchy: Header > Status strip > Mode tabs > Verify block > Search > Category chips > Menu > Sticky cart > Help FAB
- Search field above categories as high-value element
- You are here status strip as separate block
- First-time coach mark / helper
- Mode tabs always visible
- Hall verification BEFORE menu (inline, before search)
- Branding compact, speed to menu first
- Anti-patterns: popups, mandatory login, long about us, too many CTAs

MY PERSPECTIVE (Claude/CC) -- based on deep project context:

1. SEARCH IS LOW VALUE HERE. Unlike Wolt/Yandex with 1000s of items, a single restaurant has 20-60 dishes across 5-10 categories. Category chips are enough for discovery. Search adds visual noise on an already complex screen (2442 lines, 22 components). Search should be OPTIONAL -- hidden behind a magnifying glass icon, not a visible field.

2. SEPARATE STATUS STRIP IS UNNECESSARY. Table 22 Dine-in can be embedded in the header itself. Every extra visual block pushes real content (menu items) down. On mobile, pixels above the fold are precious.

3. FIRST-TIME COACH MARKS ARE OVER-ENGINEERING. QR ordering is a browse-tap-cart flow -- self-explanatory. Guests understand see food then tap then cart without instruction. Adding dismissible helpers adds complexity (state management, localStorage, render logic) for minimal gain. The flow should be intuitive by design, not explained by overlay.

4. MODE TABS SHOULD BE CONDITIONAL. When a guest scans QR at table, URL contains mode=hall. 90 percent of QR scans are hall mode. Showing Hall/Pickup/Delivery tabs is noise in this case. Tabs should appear ONLY when multiple modes are available AND the partner has enabled them. The current implementation already does this (visibleModeTabs.length > 1).

5. VERIFICATION SHOULD STAY IN CART/CHECKOUT, NOT BEFORE MENU. This is my strongest disagreement. Current flow: guest scans QR then sees menu then browses then adds to cart then enters table code to submit. Your proposal: guest scans QR then must verify table FIRST then browses menu. Problem: verification before browsing creates a GATE that blocks exploration. A guest who just wants to look at prices should not be blocked by a code entry form. The current approach lets guests browse freely, then verify only when ready to order. This is the approach used by Yandex Eda and most QR-menu systems.

6. MISSING PROJECT CONTEXT. There is an existing UX concept document for public menu (public-menu.md) with 15 agreed decisions in 3 phases. Key already-decided points:
   - Phase 1 DONE: 4 view states (loading/empty/error/success), HelpFab action sheet, StickyCartBar with post-order states
   - Phase 2 PLANNED: Plus button on dish photo, benefit mini-line, transparent pricing, i18n fixes, collapsible verify block
   - Phase 3 PLANNED: unified LoyaltySummary, success screen after order
   The verify block specifically was decided to be COLLAPSIBLE (accordion) in the cart, not a pre-menu gate.

7. WHAT YOU MISSED -- CRITICAL FOR MENUAPP:
   - Wi-Fi verification (Free plan restaurants require guest Wi-Fi connection before ordering)
   - Currency switcher (multi-currency support with formatPrice)
   - Dish ratings/reviews inline (already implemented)
   - Mobile layout toggle (list vs tile view -- already implemented)
   - The HelpFab is NOT just a secondary FAB -- it replaced a confusing bell icon after Claude+GPT discussion. It is an action sheet with 5 options.

MY PROPOSED HIERARCHY (top to bottom):
- Header: Logo + RestaurantName + LanguageSwitcher + CurrencySwitcher if multi
- Mode tabs -- ONLY if visibleModeTabs greater than 1
- Category chips -- horizontally scrollable, sticky on scroll
- Layout toggle: list/tile -- ONLY on mobile
- Menu items grid
- (bottom of screen)
- StickyCartBar -- persistent, context-aware: cart/myBill/tableOrders/empty
- HelpFab -- floating, lower-right

Table context and verification are handled INSIDE the cart/checkout flow, not as pre-menu blocks.

Please respond to my points. Where do you agree? Where do you still disagree and why? Add any new insights.
