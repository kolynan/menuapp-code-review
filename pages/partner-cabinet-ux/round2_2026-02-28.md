We are continuing the mobile UX discussion for MenuApp's partner cabinet. Here was your Round 1 analysis (summarized):

YOUR ROUND 1 POSITIONS:
- 5-item bottom nav: Glavnaya, Zakazy (Process), Stoly, Menu, Eshcho
- Priority order: Zakazy > Stoly > Menu > Glavnaya > rest
- 14 recommendations from P0 to P2
- Key suggestions: sticky save bar, two-step menu flow, settings split into separate screens, stacked cards for order process table

MY PERSPECTIVE (Claude/CC) -- here is where I agree and disagree:

AGREEMENTS (5 points):
1. Bottom nav with 5 items is correct pattern. Agree.
2. i18n fixes are P0 -- obvious, no discussion needed.
3. 44px min touch targets across all data-heavy pages. Agree.
4. Sticky save bar for partnerloyalty, partnersettings, profile. Agree -- critical for mobile.
5. partnersettings needs better section navigation. Agree on the problem.

DISAGREEMENTS (4 points):

D1: BOTTOM NAV TAB PRIORITY
You put Zakazy (Process) as #1 priority. I disagree. The partnerorderprocess page is a CONFIGURATION page -- it sets up pipeline stages (New, Accepted, Cooking, Served). It is NOT an active order queue. Partners configure this once and rarely touch it again. The actual live order management happens elsewhere. So putting it in the bottom nav is misleading. I would use: Glavnaya (home), Menu, Stoly, Personal (staff), Eshcho. The dashboard (Glavnaya) is what owners check most often on their phone -- 'how many orders today, what is the revenue.' What do you think?

D2: MENUMANAGE TWO-STEP DRILL-DOWN
You suggest categories list -> category detail as separate views. On Base44 (no-code platform), this means significant component restructuring. The simpler approach: collapsible accordion categories (already partially implemented -- each category has a chevron) + sticky category jump chips at top (like anchor links). This preserves the single-page model and is achievable with CSS changes plus minor React state. Drill-down requires routing logic that Base44 makes difficult.

D3: PARTNERSETTINGS -- SEPARATE SCREENS vs BETTER TABS
You say split into separate screens. But the screenshot shows there is ALREADY a secondary tab bar (Profile, Hours, Channels, Hall, Wi-Fi, Languages, Currencies). The real fix is: (a) make these tabs scrollable and sticky on mobile, (b) ensure each tab section is self-contained with its own save button, (c) reduce section length within each tab. Creating separate routes on Base44 is a significant platform constraint.

D4: DRAG AND DROP ON MOBILE
You did NOT mention this, but it is a major issue. Both partnertables and menumanage have drag handles for reordering. On mobile, drag gestures conflict with scroll. The tiny 6-dot grip handles are ~16px -- impossible to grab on a phone. Solutions: (a) explicit Edit/Reorder mode toggle, (b) Up/Down buttons (menumanage already has these -- they should be the primary mobile reorder method, with drag hidden on mobile), (c) long-press-to-initiate-drag if keeping native DnD.

NEW ISSUES I WANT TO ADD:

N1: WORKING HOURS GRID (partnersettings)
The 7-day time grid (Mon-Sun, each with open time, close time, working day checkbox) is extremely cramped on mobile. Each row has ~5 elements in a narrow space. Recommendation: stack vertically -- day name on one line, time pickers below it, with 'Copy to all' button to reduce input.

N2: STATISTICS CARDS OVERFLOW (partnerloyalty, partnerhome)
On partnerloyalty, there are 5 stat cards in a 3+2 grid. On a phone, these need to be 2-column or full-width stacked. On partnerhome, the 2 stat cards (Orders, Revenue) should be full-width on mobile.

N3: EMPTY STATE QUALITY (partnerhome)
The yellow 'Poka zdes pusto' banner wastes vertical space on mobile. An empty dashboard should show actionable onboarding hints: 'Add your first menu item', 'Set up your first table', 'Invite staff.' Each with a direct link to the relevant page.

N4: STAFF LIST GROUPING (partnerstaffaccess)
15+ staff cards in a flat list is hard to scan. Group by status (Active vs Waiting) with section headers and counts. The 'Otpravit priglashenie' buttons appear on some cards but not others -- unclear pattern.

Please respond: where do you agree with me? Where do you still disagree? Address D1-D4 specifically.

Your pushback is mostly correct. I’d update my Round 1 positions as follows.

**D1: Bottom nav priority**
- I agree with you: `partnerorderprocess` is configuration, not live operations, so it should not be a primary tab.
- Revised mobile tabs: `Glavnaya`, `Menu`, `Stoly`, `Personal`, `Eshcho`.
- Caveat: if there is a separate high-frequency live orders queue page, that one should compete for a tab slot.

**D2: Menumanage two-step drill-down**
- I agree with your Base44 constraint argument.
- Keep single-page IA: accordion categories + sticky jump chips is the right pragmatic choice.
- I still think one rule is necessary: default all categories collapsed (or one open) to control scroll length.

**D3: Partnersettings split screens vs better tabs**
- I agree: don’t force route splits if tabs already exist.
- Better fix is exactly your direction: sticky + horizontally scrollable tab bar, each tab self-contained, save per tab, shorter sections.
- Only split into separate routes if one tab remains too heavy after cleanup.

**D4: Drag-and-drop on mobile**
- Strong agree; this is a major issue and should be explicit P0/P1.
- Mobile pattern should be:
1. `Edit/Reorder` mode toggle
2. Up/Down buttons as primary reorder
3. Hide drag handles on mobile by default
4. If drag kept, require long-press and use larger handle hit area

On your new items: I agree with all four (`N1`–`N4`), especially `N1` working-hours layout and `N3` actionable empty states. These are high-impact mobile fixes.
