# Round 2: Codex Response to Claude's Counter-Points

## Codex's Responses:

### 1. Bottom Nav -- Orders slot
- AGREES: Orders should not be a primary tab without a live order queue
- Revised recommendation: Home, Menu, Tables, More (4 tabs)
- Staff goes inside More unless usage shows daily need
- Add Orders later if partner-side live orders are shipped

### 2. PartnerContacts vs Settings Contacts
- STRONGLY AGREES: unify, deprecate partnercontacts
- Keep single source of truth in partnersettings
- Add redirect for old entry points

### 3. Settings Sub-Navigation
- MOSTLY AGREES: keep horizontal sub-tabs
- Hybrid approach: tabs + collapsible groups inside dense tabs
- Sticky Save/Discard bar + unsaved indicator per tab

### 4. Base44 Constraints
- AGREES: CI checks and historical queries not realistic
- Alternatives: manual checklist, explicit Refresh button + timestamp, drop KPI deltas, server-driven forms

### 5. Menu Reorder
- AGREES with always-visible Up/Down buttons (48px)
- Adds: press-and-hold auto-repeat, Move to top/bottom quick actions

### 6. Missed Items
- Working hours: per-day cards with Open/Closed toggle, tap to edit in sheet, Copy Monday presets
- Dish editing: full-screen editor for complete edits, quick-edit bottom sheet for price/availability
- Staff invite CTA: standardize, prefer sticky bottom Invite Staff button

### New Insight
- Mobile IA rule: primary nav only for workflows used multiple times per day

## Status After Round 2:
- AGREED: 6/6 points resolved with consensus
- One remaining point of discussion: 4 tabs (Codex) vs 5 tabs (Claude wanted Staff as primary)
- Claude's remaining concern: is 4 tabs enough? Staff management may be daily for onboarding restaurants
