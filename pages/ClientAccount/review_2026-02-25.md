# Code Review Report: clientaccount.jsx (ClientAccount)

**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Reviewed by:** Claude (correctness + style sub-reviewers)
**File:** pages/ClientAccount/clientaccount.jsx (165 lines)

## Summary
Functional account page with proper loading/error/empty states. Uses i18n throughout. Main concern is the email source inconsistency with ClientMessages — this page reads from URL params while ClientMessages reads from localStorage.

## Critical Issues (P0) — None

## High Priority (P1) — None
The email-from-URL pattern is not a security issue in the Base44 context (lightweight loyalty auth), but the inconsistency with ClientMessages is a risk.

## Medium Priority (P2) — Document Only
- **BUG-CA-001:** Email source inconsistency — URL params vs localStorage
- **BUG-CA-002:** handleLogout doesn't clear localStorage (privacy on shared devices)
- **BUG-CA-003:** Magic number `365` for default expiry days
- **BUG-CA-004:** handleLogout defined after early returns (maintenance risk)

## Low Priority (P3) — Document Only
- **BUG-CA-005:** useMemo for email should use useSearchParams

## Statistics
- Total issues: 5 (P0: 0, P1: 0, P2: 4, P3: 1)
