=== CHAIN STEP: Discussion (3/4) ===
Chain: publicmenu-260327-065807-c24f
Page: PublicMenu

You are the Discussion moderator in a modular consensus pipeline.
Your job: resolve disputes from the Comparator step by running a multi-round discussion between CC and Codex.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Read the comparison report: pipeline/chain-state/publicmenu-260327-065807-c24f-comparison.md
2. Look at the "Disputes" section.

IF there are 0 disputes:
   - Write to pipeline/chain-state/publicmenu-260327-065807-c24f-discussion.md:
     # Discussion Report — PublicMenu
     Chain: publicmenu-260327-065807-c24f
     ## Result
     No disputes found. All items agreed or resolved by Comparator. Skipping discussion.
   - DONE. Exit immediately. Do NOT run any rounds.

IF there are 1+ disputes:
   Run up to 3 rounds of discussion. Each round:

   a) CC Position (you write):
      For each dispute, write your analysis:
      - Which solution is better and WHY (with code reasoning)
      - What edge cases or risks does each approach have

   b) Codex Position (run codex):
      Create a prompt file with CC's position and ask Codex to respond.
      Run: codex.cmd exec --model codex-mini --prompt "<prompt>" --quiet
      The prompt should include CC's position and ask Codex to:
      - Agree or disagree with CC's reasoning
      - Provide counter-arguments if it disagrees
      - Propose a compromise if possible

   c) After each round, check:
      - If both agree on all disputes → RESOLVED, stop early
      - If round 3 and still disagree → mark as UNRESOLVED for Arman

3. Write final discussion report to: pipeline/chain-state/publicmenu-260327-065807-c24f-discussion.md

FORMAT:
# Discussion Report — PublicMenu
Chain: publicmenu-260327-065807-c24f

## Disputes Discussed
Total: N disputes from Comparator

## Round 1
### Dispute 1: [title]
**CC Position:** ...
**Codex Position:** ...
**Status:** resolved/ongoing

### Dispute 2: [title]
...

## Round 2 (if needed)
...

## Round 3 (if needed)
...

## Resolution Summary
| # | Dispute | Rounds | Resolution | Winner |
|---|---------|--------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Title   | 2      | resolved   | CC/Codex/compromise |
| 2 | Title   | 3      | unresolved | → Arman |

## Updated Fix Plan
Based on discussion results, provide the UPDATED fix plan that the Merge step should use.
Include ONLY the disputed items — agreed items from Comparator remain unchanged.
Format same as Comparator's "Final Fix Plan":
1. [P0] Fix title — Source: discussion-resolved — Description
2. ...

## Unresolved (for Arman)
Items where CC and Codex could not agree after 3 rounds.
Arman must decide. Each item shows both positions.

4. Do NOT apply any fixes — only document the discussion results

=== TASK CONTEXT ===
# Small UX Fixes — ModeTabs + CartView (#162 v2)

Reference: `BUGS_MASTER.md` (PM-148, PM-149). UX agreed S182.
Production page: https://menu-app-mvp-49a4f5b2.base44.app

**Context:** Two small guest-facing UX cleanups. Previous attempt (chain 77f1) targeted the wrong file (x.jsx) and was reverted. Root cause found by Cowork: both bugs are in child components, not x.jsx. This task targets the correct files with exact line numbers.

TARGET FILES (modify):
- `pages/PublicMenu/ModeTabs.jsx`
- `pages/PublicMenu/CartView.jsx`

CONTEXT FILES (read-only):
- `BUGS_MASTER.md`

⚠️ DO NOT touch `pages/PublicMenu/x.jsx` — previous failed attempt already reverted from there.

---

## Fix 1 — PM-148 (P3) [MUST-FIX]: Remove table confirmation banner

### File
`pages/PublicMenu/ModeTabs.jsx` — only 84 lines total, easy to scan.

### Сейчас
After confirming table code, a green banner shows on the menu screen:
`✓ Стол 22 подтверждён`

This adds no value — the guest just scanned their own QR code, they already know which table they're at.

### Должно быть
Remove the green banner entirely. The banner block is at **lines 55–65**:
```
{/* Verified badge in menu view */}
{isHallMode && isTableVerified && currentTableId && (
  <div className="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-lg p-3 mb-4">
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2 text-green-800">
      <CheckCircle2 className="w-5 h-5" />
      <span className="font-medium">
        {t('form.table')} {currentTable?.name || currentTable?.code || ""} {t('x.hall.verified')}
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```
Delete this entire block (lines 55–65 including the comment). Nothing else.

### НЕ должно быть
- The green banner must NOT appear after table confirmation
- The amber "invalid table code" warning block (starts at line 67: `{isHallMode && tableCodeParam && !resolvedTable && !verifiedByCode &&`) must remain untouched

### Проверка
1. Scan QR / confirm table code → menu screen opens
2. Green "Стол X подтверждён" banner does NOT appear
3. Menu, categories, mode tabs (В зале / Самовывоз / Доставка) are visible normally

---

## Fix 2 — PM-149 (P3) [MUST-FIX]: Remove guest ID suffix from display

### File
`pages/PublicMenu/CartView.jsx` (~1046 lines).
Search for: `guestDisplay` or `effectiveGuestCode` — around **line 307**.

### Сейчас
Cart header shows: `Вы: Гость 1 #1313 ✏️` or `Вы: Timur #1313 ✏️`

The `#1313` is a system-generated guest code — internal tech detail not meaningful to the guest.

The suffix is explicitly constructed at **lines 307–309**:
```
const guestDisplay = effectiveGuestCode
  ? `${guestBaseName} #${effectiveGuestCode}`
  : guestBaseName;
```

### Должно быть
Change lines 307–309 to simply:
```
const guestDisplay = guestBaseName;
```

The `effectiveGuestCode` variable (line 300) should remain — it is used for backend/data purposes. Only the visual display construction changes. The variable `guestDisplay` is rendered at line 578.

### НЕ должно быть
- `#1313` (or any `#N` suffix) must NOT appear in the cart header
- The guest name save/edit functionality must continue to work
- `effectiveGuestCode` variable must NOT be deleted — only removed from `guestDisplay` construction

### Проверка
1. Open cart (bottom strip) → shows `Вы: Гость 1 ✏️` (no `#1313`)
2. Tap ✏️ → enter "Timur" → save → shows `Вы: Timur ✏️` (no `#1313`)
3. The name saves correctly on next open

---

## ⛔ SCOPE LOCK
- Modify ONLY `pages/PublicMenu/ModeTabs.jsx` (remove lines 55–65) and `pages/PublicMenu/CartView.jsx` (change lines 307–309)
- Do NOT touch `pages/PublicMenu/x.jsx`
- Do NOT touch any other file
- Do NOT change: table code confirmation logic, guest name save/edit logic, `effectiveGuestCode` variable, amber warning block in ModeTabs

## FROZEN UX (DO NOT CHANGE)
- PM-133 ✅: help drawer flow (openHelpDrawer logic) — in x.jsx, not touched
- PM-145 ✅: CartView floating-point total fix — keep all number formatting intact
- PM-139 ✅: guest name saves correctly (setCurrentGuest null guard)

## FROZEN UX grep verification
Before commit, verify these patterns still exist unchanged:
```
grep -n "verifiedByCode" pages/PublicMenu/ModeTabs.jsx
grep -n "effectiveGuestCode" pages/PublicMenu/CartView.jsx
```
Both should return results (variable still present, not deleted).

## MOBILE-FIRST CHECK (MANDATORY before commit)
This is a mobile-first restaurant app. Primary usage: customer phone at the table.
Before committing, verify ALL changes at 375px viewport width:
- [ ] Close/chevron buttons: RIGHT-ALIGNED (not centered), sticky top
- [ ] Touch targets ≥ 44×44px (h-11 w-11)
- [ ] No excessive whitespace/gaps on small screens
- [ ] Bottom sheet content scrollable without losing close/submit button
- [ ] No duplicate visual indicators (e.g. two gray lines that look the same)
- [ ] Text truncation: long item names don't overflow
- [ ] Sticky footer buttons don't overlap content

## Regression Check (MANDATORY after implementation)
- [ ] Table code input still works (Bottom Sheet opens, code accepted)
- [ ] Guest name edit still saves correctly (tap ✏️ → enter name → save)
- [ ] Cart header shows correct name after save
- [ ] Amber "invalid table code" warning still shows for bad QR codes (ModeTabs line 68+)

## Implementation Notes
- TARGET FILES: `pages/PublicMenu/ModeTabs.jsx`, `pages/PublicMenu/CartView.jsx`
- Do NOT use `git add .` — only: `git add pages/PublicMenu/ModeTabs.jsx pages/PublicMenu/CartView.jsx`
- git commit -m "fix(PublicMenu): remove table confirm banner (PM-148) + strip guest ID suffix (PM-149)"
- git push
